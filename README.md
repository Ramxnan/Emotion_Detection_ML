# Emotion Detection of Audio files using Machine learning

This project uses the Data set provided my Toronto emotional speech set data.

Step 1: extract the features from the audio files using MFCC, LPC, and Chroma features.<br />
Step 2: train the model using the extracted features.<br />
Step 3: test the model using the extracted features.<br />
Step 4: predict the emotion of the audio file. <br />

Models used: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Neural network MLP

Conclusion
After training the model, the accuracy of the models are: <br />
Random Forest Accuracy: 99.643% <br />
Decision Tree Accuracy: 90.357% <br />
Naive Bayes Accuracy: 80.0% <br />
MLP Accuracy: 99.286% <br />
